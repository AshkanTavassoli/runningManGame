# Fluffy Running Man Survival Mode Game

Created using only openGL(C++) without usage of any external libraries (At least I think so!)

* A great tutorial on how to install required libraries and compiler to compile this mini game on Windows: *

[Toutorial to setup openGL](https://medium.com/@bhargav.chippada19/how-to-setup-opengl-on-mingw-w64-in-windows-10-64-bits-b77f350cea7e)

If you used that tutorial make sure you link against gdi32 (i.e. add -lgdi32 to the linker command line)

You can change the camera angle and distance. A tutorial will apear once you open the game!

My first attemp at openGL, so some parts may be just exploratory stuff.

Hope you enjoy!
