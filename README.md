# Running Man Survival Mode Game

Created using onlly openGL(C++) without usage of any external libraries (At least I think so!)

A great tutorial on how to install required libraries and compiler to compile this mini game on Windows:

My first attemp at openGL, so some parts may be just exploratory stuff.

Hope you enjoy!
